# options-modeling
experiments for market options value modeling


With z_score > 3 still drop in month 10 and 12
With quantiles I use 0.01 and 0.99, not quite equivalent to z = 3 (0.0013, 0.9987)


sub_df_quantiles -> 1000 to 14
sub_df_high_entropy -> 1000 to 
sub_df_ff_centroid -> 1000 to 
sub_df_low_similarity -> 1000 to 
sub_df_inliers -> 1000 to
